## TEXT

:- In general, text is a collection 
of words or letters that are understandable 
by the reader. On a computer, text is added, viewed, 
edited, and modified using a text editor or word 
processing  program. To add text, a keyboard is most often used. 



## CALCULATOR

:-The term compute 
can have multiple meanings, but the basic meaning is the 
act of calculating a value using mathematical formulas or other methods. 
A computer processes many functions by computing information, which in its 
simplest form, is a series of ones and zeroes (called binary code).





## STORAGE

:-Where  memory refers to the location of 
short-term data, storage is the component of your computer 
that allows you to store and access data on a long-term basis. 
Usually, storage comes in the form of a solid-state drive or a hard drive.
